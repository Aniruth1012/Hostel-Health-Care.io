# Hostel-Health-Care.io
This is my first front end web development project

This is a health care situated in a hostel and a web page for describing its features.
The First Page consists of Login Page, in which reg.no and password should be given with respect to hostel id
Second Page leads into home page of the website leading to multiple subpages
It consists of five main pages with 4 pages linked in images (if you click the image, it anchors the next page)
The first image is of portal to buy medicines, which has a slideshow of top selling medicines and wonderful offers
Below that basic needs are in image formats which adds to cart on double click and single click again to remove
Below that has different types of tablets in a form which to be filled to proceed next
Next Page consists of Delivery Page, where delivery address is to be filled and order would be submitted
Coming to second portal, Booking a appointment with doctors with specialisations for a specific timing
Next portal is Booking an Ambulance
There is also a Transaction History Page which connects with back end![Uploading image.png…]()
Below these image portals, comes the text links, in four columns
First Column is About Us, consists of Director, Manager Doctor , Health Care team info and terms and conditions, privacy policy and FAQs
Next Column consists of Services, of buying medicines, consulting Doctor, Booking Scan(which will sent to Hospital Outside), and Covid Testing
Next Column gives info about all features in separate tabs
Last Column is the contact info of every post in the health care team

Technology used : HTML, CSS, JAVA SCRIPT
Problem Solution : Giving access to health care from their hostel rooms instead waiting in the que. Patients can’t wait much in the line for check up not knowing what problem they have. What if the patient has a viral fever or covid, it could spread to others and to also people who came to give a random check up. This website could help them a lot and make the process easier to access all facilities from a single place, a friend can also do for the patient if he/she is not in the position to do.
 
My Users are patients and their core need is a proper medical check up. This could reduce the time and help them to fix timings for check up instead of wasting the whole day.
Application is to make this website available to all such that every body can get access to this technology. Everybody has basic knowledge about a webpage, as it became a daily day to day usage.
